# RAID 0 IMPLEMENTATION


*RAID 0 is an excellent choice for scenarios requiring high performance and no data redundancy, such as temporary or non-critical data storage. However, due to its lack of redundancy, itâ€™s essential to back up critical data regularly. *

## Implementation Steps  for Setting Up RAID 0

<br>

### 1. Prepare the Disks
    - Ensure the disks (/dev/sdb, /dev/sdc) are unmounted and have no existing data or partitions.

```YML
sudo umount /dev/sdb /dev/sdc  # Unmount the disks

sudo wipefs -a /dev/sdb /dev/sdc  # Clear existing filesystem signatures

sudo fdisk /dev/sdb  # Repeat this for /dev/sdc to create empty partitions

```

### 2. Create RAID 0 Array
  - Use mdadm to create the RAID 0 array.


```yml
sudo mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=0 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
```
  - Explanation:

    - /dev/md0: Name of the RAID array.
    - --level=0: Specifies RAID 0.
    - --raid-devices=2: Number of disks in the array (/dev/sdb, /dev/sdc).

### 3. Verify RAID Creation
  - Check the status of the RAID array to confirm successful creation.

```yml

sudo mdadm --detail /dev/md0

lsblk  # View the block devices and RAID partitions

```

### 4. Format the RAID Array
  - Format the newly created RAID array with a filesystem (e.g., ext4).

```yml
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0
```

### 5. Create a Mount Point
  - Create a directory to mount the RAID array.

```yml
sudo mkdir /mnt/raid0
```

### 6. Mount the RAID Array
  - Mount the RAID array to the created directory.

```yml
sudo mount /dev/md0 /mnt/raid0
```

### 7. Test the RAID Array
  - Create test files in the RAID directory to confirm functionality.

```yml

sudo touch /mnt/raid0/testfile.txt

ls /mnt/raid0

```

### 8. Check Disk Usage and Performance
  - Check the disk usage and ensure the array is functional.

```yml
df -h
```
### 9. Optional: Make RAID Mount Permanent
  - Add an entry to /etc/fstab to ensure the RAID mounts at boot.

```yml
sudo bash -c "echo '/dev/md0 /mnt/raid0 ext4 defaults 0 0' >> /etc/fstab"
```

## Conclusion
*RAID 0 provides enhanced speed by striping data across disks but lacks redundancy. Always ensure critical data is backed up to prevent data loss. These steps and commands will help you set up and verify a fully operational RAID 0 array optimized for performance.*

## Summary

<br>


1. Prepare the Disks:

    - Ensure at least two unmounted and unformatted disks are available (e.g., /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc).

2. Create RAID 0 Array:

    - Combine the disks into a RAID 0 array to maximize performance by striping data.

3. Verify RAID Creation:

    - Check the RAID configuration to ensure that all disks are active and part of the array.
    - Ensure the RAID is functional.

4. Format the RAID Array:

    - Choose a filesystem (e.g., ext4) and format the RAID array.
5. Create a Mount Point:

    - Create a directory to mount the RAID array.

6. Mount the RAID Array:

    - Mount the RAID array to the created directory.

7. Test the RAID Array:

    - Create test files to ensure the RAID array is operational and accessible.

8. Check Disk Usage and Performance:

    - Use commands like df -h and performance benchmarks to confirm proper striping and high-speed operations.
